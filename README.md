# Simple Programming Language

A minimal programming language implementation with basic features like:

- Variables and assignment
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Print statements

It uses a hand-written recursive-descent parser (for flexibility).

## Examples

`

```bash
cargo run ./examples/fib.l
```
